## HipChat

HipChat integration is a major work in progress, I haven't published it to their Marketplace at this stage.

### Installation

The HipChat integration can be installed by using a Integration URL. Our Integration URL is https://get.geojs.io/v1/hooks/hipchat/install

### Usage

After installation, you can use the integration by using the IP slash command. For example `/ip 8.8.8.8`.

## Twist

### Installation

Twist makes it super easy to install our integration. You can find it in [their marketplace](https://twistapp.com/integrations/install/198_a1a4dc4678cb01d89cdc4533).

### Usage

You can use GeoJS inside Twist by using the IP slash command. For example `/ip 8.8.8.8`.

## Slack

Not quite there yet, we'll update once they're done!
