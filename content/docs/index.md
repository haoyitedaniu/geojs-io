## Domains

GeoJS is currently only available on https://get.getjs.io/. The `HTTP` version redirects to the `HTTPS` version so a non-HTTPS version is not available. There is no plan to ever change this.

There are also IPv6 and IPv4 only endpoints on https://ipv6.geojs.io/ and https://ipv4.geojs.io/ respectively.

## Formats

All endpoints either have a JSON or JavaScript/JSONP format available. The IP and Country based endpoints also have a plain text version available. Each endpoint where you can specify an IP for lookup also tags the IPs are args.
