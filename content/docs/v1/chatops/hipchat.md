HipChat integration is a major work in progress, I haven't published it to their Marketplace at this stage.

## Installation

The HipChat integration can be installed by using a Integration URL, which you can find here https://get.geojs.io/v1/hooks/hipchat/install

## Usage

After installation, you can use the integration by using the GeoJS slash command. For example `/geojs 8.8.8.8`.
