{{< message title="Feature Freeze" type="warning" >}}
In [July 2018](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/new-atlassian-slack-partnership) Slack bought HipChat and Stride from Atlassian announcing the discontinuation of both platforms. As such the HipChat integration for GeoJS will no longer recieve any feature updates.

It will continue to work, I just wont be building any new features for it.

Our HipChat integration allows you to lookup IP information from HipChat itself. Its published on the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217986/geojs-ip-lookup) and is free of charge to use.

## Installation

The HipChat integration can be installed by using our Integration URL, which you can find here https://get.geojs.io/v1/hooks/hipchat/install, or via the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217986/geojs-ip-lookup).

## Usage

After installation, you can use the integration by using the GeoJS slash command. For example `/geojs 8.8.8.8`.
