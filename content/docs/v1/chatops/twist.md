## Installation

Twist makes it super easy to install the integration. You can find it in [their marketplace](https://twistapp.com/integrations/install/198_a1a4dc4678cb01d89cdc4533).

Simply install it via the above link and you're good to go!

## Usage

Same as the above, you can use it within Twist by using the GeoJS slash command. For example `/geojs 8.8.8.8`.
