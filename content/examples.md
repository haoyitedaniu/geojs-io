## About

[Alabaster](https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster) was originally a theme for the popular documentation tool [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/). This theme port to Hugo theme is all about documentations. It should allow you to easily create a documentation for your projects.

[Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) and [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) are two examples of the Alabaster theme in the wild.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank [Telize](http://www.telize.com/) for inspiring me to create this.
