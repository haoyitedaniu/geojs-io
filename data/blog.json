I wanted to clean it up before actually publishing it. That time has now come! I've been working over the past few months in a <a href=\"https://github.com/jloh/geojs\" title=\"jloh/geojs\">git repo</a> tidying up the code and finishing off unit tests. This code is now running on the production nodes behind the service.</p>\n<p>Along with unit tests I've <a href=\"https://github.com/jloh/geojs/pull/13\">added support</a> for countries/regions/citys with non-English characters, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skarsv%C3%A5g\" title=\"Wikipedia page about Skarsvåg\">Skarsvåg</a> for example. Fun fact about Skarsvåg, apparently it is the northernmost settlement in the world that is accessible via a major road network.</p>\n<p>Last piece of GeoJS news is the launch of a simple <a href=\"https://app.geojs.io/\">web app</a> that allows you to lookup IP addresses via your browser and <a href=\"https://app.geojs.io/s/8.8.8.8\" title=\"GeoJS Web App - 8.8.8.8\">hard link</a> directly to them. Thats also open-source in its <a href=\"https://github.com/jloh/geojs-app\" title=\"GeoJS Web app source\">own repo</a>.</p>\n<small>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2726992\">Photo</a> by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:BishkekRocks\" title=\"Wikipedia User BishkekRocks\">BishkekRocks</a> - Own work, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0\" title=\"Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.</p>\n</small>","comment_id":"5aa3a9492001c40022b6d445","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/03/Nordkapp_Skarsvag.JPG","featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2018-03-10T09:45:45.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-04-01T10:03:52.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-03-10T11:45:57.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"author":"1","primary_author":null,"primary_tag":null,"url":"/posts/geojs-goes-opensource/"}
