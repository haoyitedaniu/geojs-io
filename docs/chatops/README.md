## Overview

GeoJS currently integrates with Slack, Twist App and HipChat enabling you to lookup IP information directly from chat. 

## Slack

### Installation

Slack make installation super easy. Either [click here](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?&client_id=159217363895.234425956290&scope=commands), use the button below or [search their Marketplace](https://slack.com/apps/search?q=GeoJS).

<slack-button/>

### Usage

We currently only have one command, our slash command, which you can use by typing `/geojs [ip in here]`. For example `/geojs 8.8.8.8`.

If you would like to show the result to the whole channel type `display` after the IP youâ€™re trying to lookup, eg `/geojs 8.8.8.8 display`.
